## üìù Overview

This project involves developing a machine learning model for a global finance company to classify individuals into different credit score brackets, thereby reducing manual effort in credit evaluation. Here's a detailed overview:

## üìù About the Dataset

- Link of the Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parisrohan/credit-score-classification/data
  
The dataset, crucial to the project, consists of 100,000 entries with comprehensive credit-related information for each individual. Key data points include:

Basic Information: ID, Customer_ID, Month, Name, Age, SSN, Occupation.
Financial Details: Annual Income, Monthly Inhand Salary, Number of Bank Accounts, Number of Credit Cards, Interest Rate.
Credit Information: Number of Loans, Types of Loans, Delay from Due Date, Number of Delayed Payments, Changed Credit Limit, Number of Credit Inquiries, Credit Mix, Outstanding Debt, Credit Utilization Ratio, Credit History Age, Payment of Minimum Amount, Total EMI per Month, Amount Invested Monthly, Payment Behavior, Monthly Balance.
Credit Score: The dependent variable to be predicted by the model.
Problem Statement
The company aims to build an intelligent system that can automatically classify individuals into different credit score brackets. This system is intended to streamline the credit evaluation process, reducing the time and effort involved in manual credit scoring.

## üìùTask
The primary task is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting an individual's credit score based on their credit-related information. This involves handling a mix of numerical and categorical data, dealing with missing values, and applying appropriate feature engineering techniques.

## üìù Data Science Approach
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and transforming categorical data into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms.
Feature Engineering: Identifying and selecting the most relevant features that influence credit scoring.
Model Selection: Evaluating different machine learning models to find the one that best predicts the credit score. Potential models might include  decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting machines.
Model Training and Testing: Training the model on a portion of the dataset and testing its performance on unseen data to ensure accuracy and reliability.
Evaluation: Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the model's performance in classifying credit scores.

## üìùObjectives and Applications
Automation of Credit Scoring: Reducing the manual workload involved in credit evaluation.
Risk Management: Assisting the company in managing credit risk more effectively by accurately categorizing individuals based on their creditworthiness.
Business Efficiency: Streamlining the credit assessment process, leading to faster and more efficient decision-making in lending.
